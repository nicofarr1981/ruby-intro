# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb
# puts "Hello World!"

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 7
# puts 7.77

# Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 5+2

# Strings
#puts "tofu" + 3

# Combine strings together
#puts "#{3+3+3} tacos"

# Variables
# quantity = 3+3+3
# food = "tofu"

# Combine strings and variables
# puts "#{quantity} #{food}"

# String manipulation
# puts "Hello".upcase
# puts "Hello".reverse
puts "Hello".swapcase
